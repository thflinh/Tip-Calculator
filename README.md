# AND101 Project 4 - CodeMath

Submitted by: **Linh Pham**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Tip Calculator** is an Android app that lets users quickly calculate the correct tip amount and split the bill between multiple people.  
It features live updating calculations as users type, selectable tip percentages (10%, 15%, 20%), and an optional round-up switch.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üí∞üçΩÔ∏èüì±**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] At least one (1) user input  
- [x] At least one (1) interactive View  
- [x] At least one (1) output of a calculation based on the user input  

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Implement ViewBinding to reduce boilerplate code and increase efficiency  
- [x] Add at least one (1) additional functionality (Round-up switch and split-by-people field)  

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] Real-time updates without needing a button  
- [x] Clean UI with ConstraintLayout and modern Kotlin ViewBinding  
- [x] Uses `addTextChangedListener` for reactive inputs  

## Video Demo

## Notes

This project helped me practice using ViewBinding and live updates through listeners.  
I learned how to handle invalid input gracefully and how to format currency outputs using `NumberFormat`.
